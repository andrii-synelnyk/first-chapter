# Building an Optimized Data Pipeline for Crowdsourced Nutritional Databases with Incremental Updates

## 1. Introduction

"Data is the new oil," a widely cited metaphor by Clive Humby, captures the pivotal role of data in today's digital economy. Just as oil must be refined to be useful, data must be accurately collected, meticulously cleaned, systematically enriched, and efficiently delivered to harness its full potential. 

This thesis focuses on the optimization and implementation of a robust data pipeline for crowdsourced nutritional databases with incremental updates, analogous to platforms like Yuka. It combines advanced data engineering practices and machine learning techniques to ensure data integrity, efficiency, and scalability.

The modern consumer places significant importance on nutritional transparency, driving demand for accurate, timely, and comprehensive food product data. Crowdsourced databases like OpenFoodFacts have emerged as essential resources, empowering consumers to make informed nutritional decisions. However, these platforms often face challenges related to data consistency, completeness, and latency. Incremental updates introduce complexity, requiring precise orchestration, efficient data processing, and predictive capabilities to categorize and standardize new entries effectively.

Previous research in data engineering has extensively explored various methodologies for data ingestion, cleaning, enrichment, and delivery. Incremental updates, particularly in large-scale databases, require specialized pipelines that not only handle volume but also maintain accuracy and timeliness. Recent advancements in machine learning have opened new avenues for automating complex data categorization tasks, significantly enhancing data quality and usability.

The goal of this thesis is to design and implement an optimized pipeline capable of daily incremental ingestion of product data from OpenFoodFacts API, efficient data cleaning, and transformation processes. It aims to enrich the data by automatically predicting missing product categories using a machine learning model trained on historical data. Furthermore, it will develop a scalable API deployed on cloud infrastructure, serving the processed data reliably to a mobile application.

This thesis is structured into five chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the research, detailing the significance of data engineering and machine learning in maintaining nutritional databases. It further elaborates the core components of the optimized data pipeline through focused subchapters on Data Ingestion, Data Storage, Data Cleaning, Pipeline Orchestration, API Development, ML Model Integration, and Deployment. Subsequent chapters will present detailed methodologies, discuss results from the implemented systems, and propose future research directions.

### 1.1 Data Ingestion

Data ingestion is the cornerstone of the entire data pipeline, responsible for collecting raw data from external sources and preparing it for further processing. Effective ingestion strategies ensure that the data is accurate, complete, timely, and reliable.

Several ingestion strategies have been studied and documented in literature. Batch processing, where data is collected and processed in groups, is a traditional method suitable for predictable and less dynamic data sources. Conversely, streaming ingestion continuously processes data as it becomes available, providing near-real-time data availability. An effective hybrid strategy often combines scheduled batch processing for bulk data retrieval with streaming ingestion capabilities for incremental updates, ensuring both efficiency and freshness of data.

APIs serve as critical interfaces for data ingestion, and their design significantly impacts ingestion efficiency and reliability. RESTful APIs, common for their simplicity and wide adoption, utilize standard HTTP protocols, allowing easy integration with diverse systems. Authentication mechanisms like API keys or OAuth protocols enhance security, ensuring data integrity and controlled access. Furthermore, rate limiting mechanisms and proper error handling strategies are vital to maintaining a reliable ingestion pipeline, preventing overload and ensuring stability.

Specialized data formats, typically JSON or XML, are commonly used for data transfer via APIs. JSON, due to its lightweight nature, readability, and ease of parsing, has become the predominant format, which aligns well with modern microservices architecture and facilitates integration into subsequent processing steps. Thus, JSON parsing libraries such as Pythonâ€™s built-in `json` module or high-performance alternatives like `ujson` are commonly evaluated for optimal performance during ingestion.

Furthermore, data ingestion must consider the potential variability in data schema and missing values, common in crowdsourced databases. Effective schema management techniques, including dynamic schema handling or schema validation using JSON schemas, enhance robustness. Initial data validation during ingestion reduces downstream processing complexities and improves overall data quality.

### 1.2 Data Storage

Data storage constitutes a critical component in data engineering, providing reliable, scalable, and accessible methods for preserving data. Efficient storage systems support subsequent data processing and analytical tasks, ensuring that valuable insights can be derived timely and effectively. Storage solutions must address challenges such as data volume, velocity, variety, and security.

Two primary storage paradigms are frequently employed: relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL). Relational databases, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, organize data into structured tables with predefined schemas, offering robust transaction support and consistency guarantees. They excel in scenarios requiring complex queries and structured data management.

In contrast, NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, Cassandra, or Redis handle unstructured and semi-structured data with flexible schemas, offering high scalability and performance for large volumes of distributed data. They are ideal for applications demanding rapid development cycles, horizontal scalability, and dynamic data structures.

Cloud-based storage solutions, including Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage, have gained prominence due to their scalability, durability, and accessibility. These services facilitate seamless integration with big data analytics tools and machine learning frameworks, enabling efficient data workflows and analytics pipelines.

Effective data storage strategies often incorporate hybrid architectures combining relational and non-relational solutions. This approach leverages the strengths of each system, providing optimal performance, scalability, and flexibility tailored to specific application requirements.

### 1.3 Data Cleaning

Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing or scrubbing, is the process of detecting, correcting, or removing corrupt, inaccurate, incomplete, or irrelevant data from a dataset. It is a crucial step in the data engineering pipeline, significantly impacting data quality and reliability, thereby directly influencing the accuracy and effectiveness of analytical and machine learning applications.

Typical data cleaning tasks include handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats. Missing values can arise due to errors in data collection or transmission and must be addressed using strategies such as imputation, exclusion, or prediction. Inconsistent data might result from variations in data entry practices or merging multiple data sources, necessitating normalization or reconciliation.

Duplicate detection and removal are essential to maintain data integrity and accuracy. Duplicate records can skew analytical results and adversely impact downstream tasks. Techniques such as fuzzy matching algorithms or deterministic methods based on unique identifiers help identify duplicates effectively.

Standardizing data formats ensures uniformity across datasets, facilitating integration and comparison. Common standardization practices include date formats, numeric formats, and categorical data alignment. These standardizations simplify data integration efforts and enhance data usability.

Automated data cleaning solutions employing machine learning algorithms and rule-based systems have become increasingly popular. These solutions significantly reduce manual effort and improve scalability and efficiency. However, manual validation remains crucial to handle edge cases and ensure high data quality standards.

### 1.4 Pipeline Orchestration

Pipeline orchestration refers to the automated coordination, scheduling, and management of various tasks and workflows within a data engineering system. Orchestration ensures the seamless execution of processes like data ingestion, transformation, cleaning, and storage, ensuring they occur in the correct order, at the right time, and with minimal human intervention.

Effective orchestration significantly improves the reliability, scalability, and maintainability of data pipelines. Orchestration tools manage complex dependencies between tasks, automate error handling and recovery processes, and provide comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities to track system performance.

Popular orchestration tools include Apache Airflow, Prefect, and Dagster. Apache Airflow uses Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to define workflows explicitly, offering robust scheduling and scalability. Prefect and Dagster similarly leverage DAGs but emphasize user-friendliness, scalability, and ease of deployment, making them particularly suited for modern cloud-native environments.

The orchestration layer typically integrates closely with storage solutions, processing frameworks, and analytical tools, enabling data engineers to implement sophisticated pipelines capable of handling incremental updates and real-time data processing with high efficiency and reliability.

### 1.5 API Development

API (Application Programming Interface) development involves designing, implementing, and maintaining interfaces that enable communication between different software systems. APIs facilitate the interaction between clients and servers, allowing applications to retrieve, update, and exchange data seamlessly. Effective API development ensures reliability, performance, scalability, security, and ease of use.

RESTful (Representational State Transfer) APIs are widely adopted due to their simplicity, scalability, and compatibility with standard HTTP protocols. RESTful APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. They offer clear and intuitive structures, enabling developers to efficiently integrate them into diverse software environments.

GraphQL is another popular API technology offering significant flexibility and efficiency in data fetching. Unlike RESTful APIs, which may require multiple requests to gather related data, GraphQL enables clients to specify exactly what data they need, reducing the number of API calls and improving performance. This makes GraphQL particularly suitable for modern applications with complex data requirements and limited bandwidth.

Effective API development also involves rigorous security measures to protect sensitive data. Common security practices include API keys, OAuth authentication, JWT (JSON Web Token) authorization, and rate limiting. API keys and OAuth tokens authenticate clients and manage access control, while JWT ensures secure information transfer between client and server. Rate limiting helps prevent service abuse, maintaining optimal system performance.

Additionally, comprehensive documentation is crucial in API development. Tools like Swagger and OpenAPI standardize API documentation, providing clear, interactive, and easily accessible documentation. This documentation helps developers quickly understand API functionality, facilitating efficient integration and reducing implementation errors.

Monitoring and logging are vital components of API management, enabling developers to track usage patterns, identify bottlenecks, and quickly respond to issues. Tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack provide insights into API performance and reliability, ensuring that APIs remain robust, performant, and user-friendly.

### 1.6 ML Model Integration

Machine Learning (ML) model integration refers to the incorporation of trained ML models into a data engineering pipeline, enhancing the systemâ€™s capabilities by automating complex decision-making tasks and predictions. Effective ML integration requires seamless interoperability between data processing workflows and predictive models, ensuring timely and accurate model outputs that significantly enhance data-driven decisions and insights.

Common scenarios for ML model integration involve classification, regression, clustering, and anomaly detection. Each of these applications utilizes distinct ML algorithms and methodologies suitable for specific types of data and desired outcomes. Supervised learning methods, including regression and classification algorithms, are often deployed to predict numerical outcomes or categorize data points. Conversely, unsupervised techniques like clustering are valuable for identifying inherent groupings within data without predefined labels.

Popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn facilitate efficient model training, validation, and deployment. TensorFlow and PyTorch offer advanced capabilities for building deep learning models, particularly useful in handling complex data patterns and large datasets. Scikit-learn, known for its user-friendly design and extensive documentation, is frequently used for simpler predictive modeling tasks and rapid prototyping.

Integration typically involves deploying ML models as microservices accessible via APIs or directly embedding them within data pipelines. Containerization technologies such as Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes enable scalable, portable, and consistent deployment environments, ensuring reliable performance across different stages of development and production.

Real-time model inference introduces additional considerations regarding latency, throughput, and resource utilization. Optimizing model architectures through techniques like pruning, quantization, or using lightweight models such as TensorFlow Lite or ONNX Runtime can significantly improve performance. These optimizations ensure that ML predictions remain fast and reliable, even under high-demand conditions.

Model versioning, monitoring, and retraining are critical for maintaining performance over time. Tools like MLflow and Kubeflow provide comprehensive platforms for managing model lifecycles, tracking experiments, and automating deployment processes. Continuous monitoring of model performance through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and drift detection ensures sustained reliability and effectiveness in real-world conditions.

### 1.7 Deployment
